Seedling Research

by Neil Mattson Cornell University
For head lettuce and herbs, seedlings are typically transplanted when they have 3-4 true leaves and a sufficient amount of root growth
The DLI target can be met by lighting at 250 μmol·m-2·s-1 with a 24 hour photoperiod
Also, we find best success when we begin fertilizer seedlings from day 0 (we provide 100 to 150 ppm N from a complete hydroponic fertilizer).
We find poor quality seedlings (fragile seedlings with excessive height with poor root and leaf development) when DLI is less than about 6 mol·m-2·d-1, fair quality seedlings (a bit of excessive height and slower development of sufficient leaf and root biomass) when DLI is 6-10 mol·m-2·d-1, good quality seedlings when DLI is 10-15 mol·m-2·d-1, and excellent quality when DLI is between 15-22 mol·m-2·d-1.
This is typically a linear response, so if seedlings take 11 days at 22 mol·m-2·d-1 they will take double this, 22 days, at 11 mol·m-2·d-1 and 44 days at 5.5 mol·m-2·d-1. (Referring to transplant date)

### Scientific Method Outline
Research: Look at the past work of others to see if this problem has already been tested.
Formulate a hypothesis: Identify variables and explain the expected outcome using an if/then statement.
Hypothesis: ("If _____[I do this] _____, then _____[this]_____ will happen.")
Design the experiment: Detail the materials and procedures that will be used. Identify the control variables.
Test the hypothesis: Follow the experimental design. Make observations and collect data.
Organize / Summarize the data: Make charts and graphs that explain the collected data. Summarize all observations.
Conclusions: Share what was learned by the experiment. State any potential improvements that could be made.

Ask a Question?
Which HLG LED color spectrum will grow Romaine(type) Lettuce Best? 4000k (Full Spectrum), 5000k (Full Spectrum), or Blue 450nm + Deep Red 660nm.
Variables = (4000k), (5000k), (450nm+660nm).
Do background research.
Construct a Hypothesis.
The 5000k color temperature will grow Lettuce from seed to harvest best because it contains more blue light which aids in vegetative growth, prevents stretching and bolting.
Test your hypothesis by doing an experiment.
Compare Romaine Lettuce Growth from seed to harvest between 4000k, 5000k, and 450+660nm LED lights.
Analyze your data and draw a conclusion.
Communicate your results.
Replicate experiment results more times.


Hypothesis Examples:
"A hypothesis is a possible explanation for something that is observed in nature. For example, it is a common observation that objects that are thrown into the air fall toward the earth. Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) put forth a hypothesis to explain this observation, which might be stated as 'objects with mass attract each other through a gravitational field.'"
